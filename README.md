# Premiefier

Premiefier helps you to keep up to date with movie premieres. It will notify you about the upcoming premiere via email three days before. (Notification module is not yet fully implemented.)

## Directories

* _/application_—Back-end of the application powered by [Silex](https://github.com/silexphp/Silex) framework. [Eloquent](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent) is used as ORM of choice, 'cause it's lighter and simpler to set up than Doctrine.
* _/gulpfile.js_—Gulp workflow extracted from [Frontkit](https://github.com/lamberski/frontkit) (Scaffolding & Gulp workflow for web projects.)
* _/source_—Front-end source files. Check out [Frontkit documentation](https://github.com/lamberski/frontkit/blob/master/README.md) to learn more about structure and files.
* _/public_—Public folder where all requests go. Also all static assets are put there during compilation.

## Front-End

Gulp is used to compile, minify & optimize front-end assets. Whole workflow is extracted from [Frontkit](https://github.com/lamberski/frontkit) (scaffolding & Gulp workflow for web projects). To compile the assets run:

```bash
gulp watch # This task will watch for changes in files and recompile them as needed.
gulp build # Recreate whole project.
gulp # Equivalent of 'gulp build && gulp watch'.
```

Keep in mind that in order to run above commands you need to have `npm`, `gulp` and `bower` installed.  Also, run `npm install && bower install` first to install all dependencies.

## Configuration

Configuration of the app—including database path, API keys, SMTP setup—is based on environment variables to remove all confidential data from the repository. [_config.php_](application/config.php) file is located in _/application_ directory. Below is list of all required variables:

| Key | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `DEBUG`   | Whether application should be run in debug mode. |
| `API_KEY` | Rotten Tomatoes API key. You can get one by [registering the app](http://developer.rottentomatoes.com/) on their site. |
| `DB_PATH` | Path to _*.sqlite_ file with the database. |
| `MAIL_*`  | SMTP-related configuration to set Swift Mailer up. You can find more information in [Silex documentation](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/doc/providers/swiftmailer.html). |

## Database

Site is using SQLite to store data. Schema of the database is located in [_schema.sql_](schema.sql).

## Deployment

Premiefier has deployment mechanism already set up. It's using simple yet powerful [Deployer](http://deployer.org/). Servers configuration is loaded from external YAML file _deploy.yml_ (which is not included to the repository). Learn more about serverList() in [Deployer documentation](http://deployer.org/docs/servers). To deploy files to the server run:

```bash
dep deploy
```
